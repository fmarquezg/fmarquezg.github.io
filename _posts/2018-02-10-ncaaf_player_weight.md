On standard formations, the ofensive line (OL) consists of Center, 2 Guards, 2 Offensive Tackles and sometimes 1 or 2 Tight ends. Right in front of the OL, the denfensive line (DL) lines up. The DL consists of 1 or 2 Defensive tackles, and 2 defensive ends. 

OL tend to be heavier than DL.This make sense, since defensive linement are the ones who need to be agile to sneek between the holes to sack the QB. On the other hand you the OL needs to hold its ground and essentially be the 'unmovable object'.
