OL and DL, 'the big guys' are who determine if a quarterback or running back are going to have a succesfull day.

Offensive Line consists of Center, 2 Guards, 2 Offensive Tackles and sometimes 1 or 2 Tight ends


Deffensive Line consists of 1 or 2 Defensive tackles, and 2 defensive ends


I analyze the 3 most recent (2015-2017) rosters for the top 11 NCAA Football and also included oklahoma football.

The teams are:

1- Texas
2 - Alabama
3 - Clemson
4 - Baylor
5 - Georgia
6 - Ohio State
7 - Michigan
8 - Notre Dame
9 - Wisconsin
10 - UCF
11 - Texas Tech
12 - oklahoma


From the data, it looks like Offensive Linemen tend to outweight the Defensive linemen. This make sense, since after all you want your bigger guys protecting the QB. Also, defensive linement are the ones who need to be agile to sneek between the line and sack the QB.
