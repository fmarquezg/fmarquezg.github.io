I compare Dorial Leonard (Sr.) and Collin Johnson's (So.) Game Day Perfomrance. To see which receiver should be the starting. The data accounts for the 2017 Season up to the TCU game.

For purposes of the analysis and charts:

  * Receiver A: Dorian Leonard (DL) Sr.
  * Receiver B: Collin Johnson (CJ) So.

| Dorian Leonard      | 25 | 13 | 52.0% |

Check yardages

Check last 2 games (ackwoledge shitty start, CJ is a sophomore 

**The probability of Dorian Leaonard being better than Collin Johnson is 51%**, so this is pretty much a 50-50. 



### Validation
For those who need the converge test in the above analysis...
