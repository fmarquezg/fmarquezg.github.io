Punter's (aka Michael Dickson) is showing spectacular punting skills by pinning teams in their own 10. So the natural question is, what can we expect if we have the league's beat punter playing with the league's best field goal kicker?


Most drives end up in punts. During the 2017 season, 53% of drives ended in punts.

Drives starting within the own 15th yard line ended in punts *63%* of the time.

Those teams who ended up punting, traveled an average of 26 yards

## The Average Punt

Drives starting from own 15, traveled on average 26 yards before having to punt. These punts travelled on average 41 effective yards (effective yards = punt distance - return yards +/-penalty yards).

## Yards needed for J Tucker to score

Adding the 26 travel yards and the 42 effective punt yards to the initial position (15) we end up in our own 17th yard.

To add 3 points on the board, the offense need to place the ball between the opposing team's 30th and 40th yard line.
