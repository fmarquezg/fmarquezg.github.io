Punter's (aka Michael Dickson) is showing spectacular punting skills by pinning teams in their own 10. So the natural question is, what can we expect if we have the league's beat punter playing with the league's best field goal kicker?


Most drives end up in punts. During the 2017 season, 53% of drives ended in punts.

Drives starting within the own 15th yard line ended in punts 63% of the time.

Those teams who ended up punting, traveled an average of 26 yards





To add 3 points on the board, the offense need to place the ball between the opposing team's 30th and 40th yard line.
