Comparing

Writing this right after the heartbreaking loss to OSU (10/21/2017). 

Amanti Foreman did not play during this game and as a matter of fact, has not played in the last 3 games. 

Is our 'Golden Boy' coach missing out by benching him?


| Player        | Yards Gained           | Passes  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| Reggie Hemphill-Mapps      | 306 | 28 |
| Lil'Jordan Humphrey      | 175      |   13 |
| Armanti Foreman | 176      |    14 | 


3rd Down Situations

| Player        | # of Targeted Times           | 1st downs           | 1st down Conversion Rate           |

| Reggie Hemphill-Mapps      | 8 | 4 | 50% |
| Lil'Jordan Humphrey      | 8 |   4 | 50% |
| Armanti Foreman | 176      |7|  5 | 71% |



We define a conversion as:

1. 1st or 2nd down AND the at least 3 yards are gained as a result of the play
2. 3rd or 4th down AND the yards required for the 1st down are met
