Writing this right after the heartbreaking loss to OSU (10/21/2017). 

Armanti Foreman did not play during this game and as a matter of fact, has not played in the last 3 games. I do not have practice statistics so I will limit this to Game Day statitics for the current season.


We define a conversion as:

1. 1st or 2nd down AND the at least 3 yards are gained as a result of the play
2. 3rd or 4th down AND the yards required for the 1st down are met


| Player        | Yards Gained           | Passes  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| Reggie Hemphill-Mapps      | 306 | 28 |
| Lil'Jordan Humphrey      | 175      |   13 |
| Armanti Foreman | 176      |    14 | 


Target Statistics

| Player        | # of Targeted Times           | 1st downs           | 1st down Conversion Rate           |

| Reggie Hemphill-Mapps      | 42 | 28 | 67% |
| Lil'Jordan Humphrey      | 30 |   13 | 43% |
| Armanti Foreman        |24|  14 | 58% |
