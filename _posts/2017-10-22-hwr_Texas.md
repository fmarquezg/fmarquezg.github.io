Comparing

Writing this right after the heartbreaking loss to OSU (10/21/2017). 

Amanti Foreman did not play during this game and as a matter of fact, has not played in the last 3 games. 

Is our 'Golden Boy' coach missing out by benching him?

We define a conversion as:

1. 1st or 2nd down AND the at least 3 yards are gained as a result of the play
2. 3rd or 4th down AND the yards required for the 1st down are met
