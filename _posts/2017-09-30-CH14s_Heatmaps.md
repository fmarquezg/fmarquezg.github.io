In this post, I'm going to review Javier "Chicharito" Hernandez (aka Chichadios) heatmaps' with during the 2016-2017 season with Bayer Leverkusen. I will compare his heatmaps with the heatmaps produced by other top players to see how Hernandez moves and see if we can classify him as a 'poacher' or a dynamic 9. 
<p>
The analysis is based on Convoluted Neural Network (CNN). The same algorithm used to classify images.

Players included in this analysis are:
  * Bullet 1
* Madzukic
* Arturo Vidal
* Lewandoski
* Benzema
* Edinson Cavani
* Zlatan Ibrahimovich
* Romelu Lukaku
* Gonzalo Higuain
* Luis Suarez
* Marco Verratti
* Kylian Mbappe
* Luka Modric
* Toni Kroos
* MagIsco Alarcon
* Cristiano Ronaldo
