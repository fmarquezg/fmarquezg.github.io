Comparisons are never fair or easy, however we tend to always compare things. In the world of soccer, we compare players and use metrics such as goals, assists, silverwear earned or even contract sizes as ways to quantify which player is 'better'. Most of the times we compare players in the same filed position but as team tactics evolve, it becomes hard to find two players developing the same role.

<br>

In this post I'm proposing a way to identify which players can be compared to each other based on their field positioning. To keep this simple I will compare only players' heatmaps. The control in here will be the greatest striker to bless this Earth.... Javier "Chicharito" Hernandez (aka Chichadios). 

<br>

I will compare his club heatmaps during the 2016-2017 season with the heatmaps produced by other top players to see which players can be 'fairly' compared to Hernandez.
